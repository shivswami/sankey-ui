# Sankey-ui: Interactive Sankey Diagram creation

## Motivation
I have long loved field of data visualisation and followed greats of field like Edward Tufte and was always keen to explain my work with appropriate visualisation.
Sankey diagrams have been on my mind since 2015 or so and I did few Python based experiments
But I always wanted to create something reusable.


# Where's AI / GenAI in the app ? 
My personal take is that Generative AI doesn't have to be real time in every applications. It can be used to 
- ✅ Build applications faster (Time to market)
- ✅ Learn new technologies on the go (New skills, productivity)
- ✅ Brainstorm on application ideas and use
- ✅ Generate content for application like text, translations, images and enhance the user experience.

I used GenAI in this project is developer copilot (Used both OpenAI canvas and Cursor), Product manager copilot (OpenAI o1-preview), business analyst(words and image list for the game via OpenAI gpt-4o ) and operator copilot (Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the terminal via Cursor).
